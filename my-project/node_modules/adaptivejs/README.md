## Getting Started

We've supplied an example adaptive.js project as a starting point for you in the example folder.  To get it running:

  1. cd into the example directory
  2. run `npm install`
  3. run `bower install`
  4. run `grunt preview`
  5. Navigate to http://preview.mobify.com
  6. For the Site URL, enter the website you want to adapt.  **NOTE:** The site must have a Mobify tag installed in order for the site to adapt.
  7. For the bundle location enter: http://localhost:8080/build/
  8. Hit authorize and you should see an example adapted view!

The example is using the code inside of the `adaptivejs/src` folder, so during development, you can use this example
as a way of testing your changes.

## Running the tests

To run your tests in the browser, run the following:

    grunt test_browser

And browse to:

   http://localhost:8888/tests/ 

## Releasing

When releasing a new version, follow these steps:

1. Make sure all tests pass locally using `grunt test`.
2. Make sure all tests pass on saucelabs with `grunt test_saucelabs`.
3. Bump version in package.json
4. Add to CHANGELOG
5. Create a new git tag corresponding to that version and push to origin.
6. `npm publish`
