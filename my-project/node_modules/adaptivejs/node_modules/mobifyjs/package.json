  "readme": "# Mobify.js\n\nMobify.js is an open source library for improving responsive sites\nby providing responsive images, JS/CSS optimization, Adaptive\nTemplating and more. Mobify.js also provides a \n\"Capturing\" API for manipulating the DOM before any resources have\nloaded, giving developers the ability to enable the listed features above\nwithout changing any backend markup.\n\nFor instructions on how to use the library, follow the instructions on [mobifyjs.com](http://www.mobifyjs.com/)\nor build the docs site manually in the instructions below.\n\n## Development\n\n### Building\n\nMobify.js uses Bower, Grunt.js and Require.js to build the library, and manage all of the dependencies. First, you will need to install the grunt-cli globally:\n\n    npm install -g grunt-cli\n\nAnd then download the latest code from git and install the dependancies:\n\n    git checkout https://github.com/mobify/mobifyjs.git\n    cd mobifyjs\n    npm install\n    bower install\n\nNow, to build the library, simply run the following command:\n\n    grunt build\n\nOpen the `build` folder to see the generated Mobify.js libraries.\n\nMobify.js is built with AMD modules using almond.js.\n\nIn order to build Mobify.js during development without having to run\n`grunt build` everytime you change a file, run the following command:\n    \n    grunt serve\n\nThis will run a development server on http://localhost:3000 using connect,\nand build the library every time the files in `src` change.\n\nTo see how the project is setup to build, open up `Gruntfile.js` and have a look!\n\n#### Build Setup\n\nRequire.js is used to build Mobify.js. \n\n - src/config.js # The require.js base config for all build mobify.js builds\n - src/mobify-library.js # Defines how to build the full mobify.js library\n\nThere is also an example custom build file to make it simple to build a custom\nmobify.js library (or to compile the library with executable code):\n\n - mobify-custom.js.example\n\nTo create a custom build, run the following:\n\n    `cp mobify-custom.js.example mobify-custom.js`\n\nThen, run `grunt serve` as normal. The output of the custom build will be\nlocated in `build/custom`.\n\n**Note: We use a `mobifyjs` symlink to resolve paths so they can be the same\nlocally as they are on the CDN. This can be problematic for Windows.**\n\n### Tests\n\nTests for Mobify.js are written in QUnit. To run them individually, run\n`grunt serve` and then go to `http://localhost:3000/tests/capture.html`\nor any other of the QUnit tests in the /tests/ folder.\n\nTo run all of the tests in an automated fashion using Phantomjs\n(the headless webkit browser) run the following command:\n\n    grunt test\n\nIt's also important when developing not to run into any regressions on all of the\nsupported browsers. The Gruntfile is setup to be able to run qunit tests\non many browsers we support (in order to do this yourself, you will need to set\n`SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_KEY` in your environment variables).\n\n    grunt saucelabs\n\n## Deploying\n\nBy default, the deploy command is set to deploy Mobify.js to cdn.mobify.com. To deploy\nhere, ensure `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are set in your\nenvironment variables.\n\n    grunt deploy\n\n## Browser support\n\nUsing Capturing:\n\n - All Webkit browsers (Safari, Chrome, Netfront, etc)\n - Firefox - version 4 and up\n - Opera - 11 and up (previous versions untested)\n - IE - 10 and up\n\nNot Using Capturing:\n\nSupport for using the API without Capturing has not been tested, but it will\nat minimum support the browsers listed above (as well, it should cover many \nolder browsers)\n\n##  Docs\n\nThe compiled documentation for Mobify.js can be found online at [mobifyjs.com](http://www.mobifyjs.com/).\n\nThe static site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Run the following commands to get the docs running locally:\n\n    gem install jekyll\n    grunt jekyll\n\nThen navigate to http://localhost:4000/mobifyjs/docs/.\n\n",
