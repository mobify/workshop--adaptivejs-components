# Introduction to Stencil

In this step we are going to learn how a Stencil Component is similar to, as well as they differ from, Adaptive Components and how they work with Adaptive.js projects.


## What is Stencil?

Stencil is just the name for our (Mobify's) *reusable, curated set* of Adaptive Components that can be installed and re-used across projects.

At their core Stencil components are just Adaptive Components with a bit of extra plumbing. That extra plumbing is to help test and maintain that component because it is completely isolated from any project.


## How Do They Work with Adaptive.js Projects?

Stencil was built to be very easy to use in Adaptive.js projects. As such, there are command line tools that are used to install (or uninstall) Stencil components to a project. Once they've been installed, they can be immediately integrated into any template!

We'll go through all the steps for adding a Stencil to a project in the next step!


## What Stencils Are There That I Can Use?

You've already seen one in the previous step: `stencil-select`! While there are many, for the purpose of this Workshop we will only cover the following:

* Card Component (a.k.a. `stencil-card`)
* Tabs Component (a.k.a. `stencil-tabs`)

In the proceeding steps we are going to learn how to install these Stencil components, how to include them in a template, and how to customize their markup, styles and functionality.


## Done! Onward!
