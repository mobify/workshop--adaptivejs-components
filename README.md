# Introduction to Stencil

In this section, we'll learn about the similarities and differences between Adaptive and Stencil Components, and how Stencil Components work with Adaptive.js projects.


## What is Stencil?

Stencil is just the name for our (Mobify's) *reusable, curated set* of Adaptive Components that can be installed and re-used across projects.

At their core, Stencil components are just Adaptive Components with a bit of extra plumbing that allows us to easily test and maintain them, since they are completely isolated from any project.


## How Do They Work with Adaptive.js Projects?

Stencil was built to be very easy to use in Adaptive.js projects. There are command line tools that are used to install (or uninstall) Stencil components within a project. Once they've been installed, the components can be integrated into any template!

We'll go through all the steps for adding a Stencil to a project in the next section!


## What Types of Stencils Are There?

You've already seen one in the previous step: `stencil-select`! While there are many, for the purpose of this Workshop we will only cover the following:

* Card Component (a.k.a. `stencil-card`)
* Tabs Component (a.k.a. `stencil-tabs`)

In the following sections, we are going to learn how to install these Stencil components, how to include them in a template, and how to customize their markup, styles and functionality.


## Done! Onward!

1. In the `workshop--adaptivejs-components` directory, run the following command to proceed to the next topic in the workshop:

    ```
    git checkout part-1-install-components
    ```

2. Proceed to [Installing Components](https://github.com/mobify/workshop--adaptivejs-components/blob/part-1-install-components/README.md), the first topic in the workshop!
