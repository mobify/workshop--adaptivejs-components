# Part 1: Installing Components

Now that we understand what Adaptive and Stencil components are, let's get our hands dirty!


## Installing Stencil Components

Open up your Terminal and navigate to the project directory that we've pre-generated for you.

```
cd my-project
```

Let's install the Card and Tabs Stencil components using the following commands:

```
grunt component:install:card --branch dev
```

As well as...

```
grunt component:install:tabs --branch dev
```

> __Note__ When Adaptive components are out of beta, the `--branch dev` flag wonâ€™t be needed.

> __Note__ The `grunt component` command must be executed from inside an Adaptive.js project

The `grunt component:install:` command installs a Stencil component via Bower and "auto-magically" modifies the necessary files to ensure that the component can be used right away.


## Add the Stencils to a Template

Now that we've installed our two Stencil components, let's go ahead and add them to a template file.

Open `/my-project/app/pages/home/home.dust` in your text editor of choice and add the following:

```html
<div class="t-home__section">
    {@c-card title="My Card Title"}
        <p>Hello world!</p>
    {/c-card}
</div>

<div class="t-home__section">
    {@c-tabs}
    {:tabStrip}
        {@c-tabs__tab}Tab 1{/c-tabs__tab}
        {@c-tabs__tab}Tab 2{/c-tabs__tab}
    {:body}
        {@c-tabs__pane}Pane the first{/c-tabs__pane}
        {@c-tabs__pane}Pane the second{/c-tabs__pane}
    {/c-tabs}
</div>
```


## Preview the Installed Components

In the terminal, run the following command:

```
grunt preview
```

Open up your browser of choice and navigate to [this page](https://preview.mobify.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.merlinspotions.com%2F&site_folder=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2Fadaptive.js&disabled=0&domain=&scope=1). Click the **"Preview"** button, as per the below screenshot:

Once the preview site loads, you should see the homepage template fully rendered along with the two Stencil components we added above!
